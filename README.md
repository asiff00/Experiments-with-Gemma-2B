Gemma 2B is a Large Language Model (LLM) from Google DeepMind. It’s part of the Gemma family, built with the same technology as the Gemini models. It comes with pre-trained and instruction-tuned variants and is released with a commercial license and a Responsible Generative AI toolkit.
 
I’ll be testing different Gemma models and sharing the results here and on my Hugging Face space. Stay tuned for updates!
